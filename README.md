This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic behavior in R when subsetting data frames using character vectors.  If the character vector contains column names that do not exist in the data frame, R silently drops those names without issuing a warning or error. This can lead to unexpected data manipulations and difficult-to-debug errors. The `bug.R` file reproduces the issue, while `bugSolution.R` presents a solution using more robust subsetting methods.
